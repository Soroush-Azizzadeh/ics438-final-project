BERT Model Download Notice
We utilized the BERT ('bert-base-uncased') model for processing receipt data. 

If you have previously downloaded the BERT model ('bert-base-uncased') on your machine, the application will use the existing model, ensuring a faster setup.
If the BERT model is not already present on your system, the application will automatically download it upon initial run. Note that this model is approximately 400MB in size, and the download time will depend on your internet connection speed.
