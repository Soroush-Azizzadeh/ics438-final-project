BERT Model Download Notice
We utilized the BERT ('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens') model for processing receipt data. 

If you have previously downloaded the BERT model ('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens') on your machine, the application will use the existing model, ensuring a faster setup.
If the BERT model is not already present on your system, the application will automatically download it upon initial run.
